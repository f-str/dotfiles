# dotfiles & instructions

My personal configuration files for my Linux systems. Use at your own risk :D


## Installation

For installing this configuration files on your system execute the following command (make sure `wget` and `yay` are installed):
```sh
$ wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fload2000/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

This install script will automatically install all requirements (which are listed below), clones the configuration files and moves them to the right directory.


## My currently used programs

With the included script `installPrograms.sh` it is possible to install all the programs I use on a daily drive.  
This is mainly for me to speed up the install process of new OS installs.


## Instructions
Head to the wiki page for my install instructions for Arch Linux.
